## Types of JavaScript

There are two types of JavaScript usage:

* **Internal JavaScript:** JavaScript code written directly within the `<script>` tags in an HTML file.

* **External JavaScript:** JavaScript code stored in a separate file and linked using the `<script>` tag with a `src` attribute pointing to the file.

**Benefits:**

* **Internal:** Quick for small scripts and testing.
* **External:** Better for reusability, organization, and separating code from content.
