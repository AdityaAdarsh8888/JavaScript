# Conditional (Ternary) Operator in JavaScript

The conditional operator, often referred to as the ternary operator, is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement in JavaScript. It takes three operands and evaluates to a value based on a condition.

## Syntax

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

- **condition**: An expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- **expressionIfTrue**: The value or expression executed if the condition is `true`.
- **expressionIfFalse**: The value or expression executed if the condition is `false`.

## Key Features

- **Compactness**: More concise than if-else.
- **Expression-based**: Always returns a value.
- **Nested Ternary**: Can be nested, though it's not recommended for readability.

## Advantages

- Reduces the number of lines of code.
- Improves code readability when used appropriately.

## Disadvantages

- Can make code harder to read when overused or nested excessively.
- May reduce maintainability in complex cases.
